# The coursera course "Developing Data Products" assignment

The reop contains two files "ui.R" and "server.R". These two files form a shiny app and the former defines the user 
interface and the latter defines what the app is.

The shiny app is used to show the performance of three classification methods, namely knn, cart and nnet on the
data set "iris". Users can define the proportion of the training data from the whole data set and see the 
performance of the trained model on the testing data. The seed can also be defined by users too.
